# faq-rpm

Supports building https://github.com/jzelinskie/faq as an srpm/rpm

## Copr

This package is available on copr at https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ecnahc515/faq/.
Please use copr if you wish to install the RPM using dnf/yum by enabling the copr repository on your machine.

## Building:

Building the RPM is the same as any other RPM, but here are instructions if you're just starting out building RPMs.

### rpmbuild

Requirements:

- [rpmbuild](http://rpm.org/download.html)
- gcc, make
- go >= 1.11
- jq-devel >= 1.6

First fetch the sources for `faq` for the SRPM to build:

Using spec tool (available via rpmdev-tools package):

```
spectool -g -R faq.spec
```

You can also download it them directly via rpmbuild:

```
rpmbuild --undefine=_disable_source_fetch -bp faq.spec
```


Build the source rpm, and binary:

```
rpmbuild -ba faq.spec
```

If you want to build just the source RPM:

```
rpmbuild -bs faq.spec
```


### Mock

Using mock has advantages over calling rpmbuild directly, like running in an
isolated chroot, and the fact that it installs all the build dependencies for
the RPM automatically.

Requirements:

- [mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock)
- [rpmbuild](http://rpm.org/download.html)


First, download the sources, and build the srpm using the instructions above.

Then use mock to build the rpm:

```
mock --enable-network --rebuild $HOME/rpmbuild/SRPMS/faq-0.0.4-1.fc29.src.rpm
```

If you want to build for different OS versions, pass the `-r` flag to change
the profile used to make the chroot:

```
mock -r epel-7-x86_64 --enable-network --rebuild $HOME/rpmbuild/SRPMS/faq-0.0.4-1.fc29.src.rpm
```
